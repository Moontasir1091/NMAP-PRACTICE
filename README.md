# Nmap Practice

This repository contains my hands-on practice with Nmap for network scanning
and service enumeration.

## What I am practicing
- TCP scanning
- UDP scanning
- Service version detection
- OS detection

## Tools
- Nmap
- Linux (Kali Linux)

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to understand how network scanning works
and how attackers identify open ports and services during reconnaissance.

This repository is for learning and educational purposes only.
